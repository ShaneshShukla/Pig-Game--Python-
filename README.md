# Pig-Game--Python-
Pig games typically involve rolling dice and making strategic decisions.
In a basic version, players take turns rolling a single die and accumulating points, 
aiming to reach a certain score without rolling a "pig" (1). If they do roll a pig, 
they lose all points gained in that turn.
Players can choose to stop and bank their points or risk rolling again to accumulate more,
but riskier strategies can lead to bigger losses.
